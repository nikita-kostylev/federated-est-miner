# Federated eST-Miner

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis "Developing a Federated eST-Miner"

To run the code, the OpenFHE docker container is needed.


The homomorph code directory contains:
-the key setup(server.py,client.py,run.sh)
-the Combined Log Generation(server2.py,client2.py,run2.sh)
-the federated eST-Miner(server3.py,client3.py,run3.sh) 

test.py is starting the regular eST-Miner and the regular eST-Miner with place removal.

securitymetrics.py contains all privacy metrics and trace reconstruction mechanisms that were developed. 

renameT.py was used to create the synthetic logs contained in logandother.
